For over a decade we have been working to help transform lives in some of the poorest, hardest-to-reach parts of the world. Our aim is to inform, connect and empower people around the world.  The global reach and reputation of the BBC strengthen our work. But we are not funded by the UK TV licence fee. As a registered charity, grants and donations make our work possible.   “It is an old saying that knowledge means power; the better informed you are, the greater your chances of success. ” Kofi Annan, Former Secretary General of the United Nations",

Van oorsprong zijn we gespecialiseerd in het ontwerpen, bouwen en onderhouden van het spoor. Dit onderhoud doen wij bijvoorbeeld rondom grote steden als Rotterdam, Amsterdam en Utrecht en bij project ZwolleSpoort realiseren we de nieuwbouw rondom Zwolle. Maar inmiddels doen we veel meer dan alleen spoor. Zo voeren we ook werk uit aan sluizen, tunnels en bruggen. Dit doen we onder andere aan de Waalbrug en aan de Van Brienenoordbrug. Daarnaast werken we op Schiphol aan passagiersbruggen en lichtmasten. Daarbij maken wij onderscheid tussen service en onderhoud en projecten. Kortdurende projecten van een week of 8 en langdurige projecten van soms wel meer dan een jaar.  We zijn een klantgericht bedrijf en zijn trots op ons innovatieve vermogen. Als onderdeel van een krachtig VolkerWessels hebben we vele expertises binnen handbereik. We zijn opdrachtgevers graag van dienst met een integrale en multidisciplinaire aanpak waarbij veiligheid en vakmanschap de kern vormen.",

From the beginning, Hendrickson's only business has been to serve the needs of the commercial vehicle industry. This focus, bolstered by an unrelenting pursuit of technological leadership, is the key to our status as the world leader in the design and manufacture of high quality truck, tractor, and trailer suspensions, liftable suspensions, steel leaf springs, bumpers, and stamped components for the heavy-duty transportation market.  Since its acquisition by The Boler Company in 1978, Hendrickson has grown five-fold. Today, Hendrickson is a major supplier to every North American heavy-duty truck and trailer OEM, as well as many manufacturers in Europe, Australia, Mexico, Japan, and Latin America. Our products are helping these partners increase durability, lower operating costs, enhance driver comfort, and reduce weight. And after producing more than 2,000,000 walking beam truck suspensions and 2,000,000 air-ride trailer suspensions, our goal continues to be providing the most technologically advanced and differentiated products available—today and for the road ahead.",

Em 2008, após o spin-off da incumbente, a empresa assumiu a nova designação, ZON Multimédia, e uma nova estratégia assente na liderança do Triple Play, na excelência na relação com cliente e operações e na captura de oportunidades de crescimento orgânico.   A inovação fez parte do ADN do grupo desde o primeiro dia, permitindo sustentar desde sempre a liderança na TV por subscrição, na exibição e distribuição cinematográfica em Portugal. A ZON Multimédia distinguiu-se ainda pelo lançamento do primeiro serviço integrado de triple play no país, pela liderança tecnológica nos serviços de banda larga de nova geração e pela introdução da IRIS, o serviço que revolucionou o paradigma da televisão linear.  Em agosto de 2013, a ZON e a Optimus fundem-se dando origem a uma empresa única. A NOS acabaria por nascer em maio de 2014, posicionando-se como uma empresa ainda mais sólida, responsável, orientada para o futuro e comprometida com a excelência e a satisfação dos clientes particulares e empresariais.",

			"Description": "The woman appeared in Kununurra Court at the end of June and the case was referred to a higher court in Perth, where she is due to appear again later this year.  It is understood the woman has to remain in the Perth area while awaiting court proceedings on the charge which carries a maximum penalty of two years in jail .  Speaking to ABC news, Western Australia Criminal Lawyers Association president, Linda Black, has said the case is unusual.  \"It's a charge that seems to be rarely used, I can't recall the last time I heard of anyone being charged with this\".  She added: \"Most countries around the world have a law requiring births to be reported, no matter what the circumstances.  \"It's a charge that's certainly not unique to Western Australia.  \"Without wanting to trivialise the matter, we just can't have people storing dead bodies all over the place without it being brought to the attention of the authorities and dealt with in a proper and formal way, so I think there's a strong public policy behind it.\"  People in the town where the woman was hospitalised have said they are surprised that the woman has been charged.   One resident said:  \"The experience of giving birth to a stillborn child in a foreign country must have been very traumatic, especially when it was unexpected.\"  Ms Black added that police should always use discretion in cases such as this, stating that some thought must be given as to whether or not a criminal charge is appropriate.   http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/irish-backpacker-charged-hiding-body-4022904#ixzz39ml5T5Kc Follow us: @DailyMirror on Twitter | DailyMirror on Facebook",

			"Description": "Microsoft acquired Incent Games Inc in August 2015.  Incent Games Inc. is the developer and owner of FantasySalesTeam, an innovative sales gamification platform that’s helped hundreds of companies boost sales productivity, drive revenue and improve CRM adoption through collaboration and team based competition. It was designed by a team of software industry veterans and people that have been in the trenches by phone, foot, and plane selling and managing teams. It’s run by people that are truly passionate about helping companies drive higher performance from their sales force and who want to run a better breed of sales contest.  Through dozens of discussions with sales managers and reps we identified what makes for effective and ineffective sales contests. We recognized that to run a truly great SPIFF program, a simple software platform was necessary. One that’s flexible and customizable to fit any sales environment, can monitor dozens of performance metrics without operational hassle, and rewards competitive as well as team based selling.

Vår strävan är att uppnå en personalsammansättning som speglar samhället och kommuninvånarna.   Hos oss är framgång en laginsats där vi tillsammans möjliggör det goda livet för invånarna i Skara kommun. Vi anser att vi har ett av Sveriges viktigaste jobb!

			"Description": "Computers en daarmee ICT, zijn niet meer weg te denken uit onze samenleving. Het is niet alleen iets voor volwassenen, ook kinderen worden al vroeg geconfronteerd met deze digitale wereld. Het is dan ook belangrijk dat we al op jonge leeftijd wijs worden gemaakt met ICT. Wij zijn van mening dat ICT, net als taal- en rekenonderwijs, een vak op de basisschool zou moeten zijn. Van onze kinderen wordt op school verwacht dat ze gebruik maken van elektronische hulpmiddelen zoals PowerPoint voor hun spreekbeurt, zonder dat ze er les in krijgen. Daarnaast zitten veel kinderen al op het internet zonder dat ze weten van de do’s en don’ts. Niet iedere ouder is in staat om zijn kind te helpen met deze moderne technologie. Maar ook veel leerkrachten zijn (nog) niet in staat om onze kinderen daarin te ondersteunen! WizzFox biedt de oplossing: slim & flexibel alles leren over ICT!  WizzFox is een ICT leermethode via het internet die zowel klassikaal als individueel gevolgd kan worden. WizzFox neemt als het ware de rol van de leerkracht over en brengt op een speelse manier de kennis over op kinderen maar ook op volwassenen. Er worden korte interactieve filmpjes getoond met daarin een uitleg over een bepaald onderwerp binnen de ICT. Na zo’n filmpje volgt er óf een quiz óf er wordt een praktijkoefening gedaan. Na het volledig doorlopen van het programma en het behalen van de nodige scores krijgt de leerling een WizzFox ICT diploma. Overal waar een computer met internet voorhanden is kan met WizzFox geleerd worden!",

It functions as a rescue mechanism for insolvent entities and allows them to carry on running their business. The process – an alternative to liquidation – is often known as going into administration. A company in administration is operated by the administrator (as interim chief executive) on behalf of the creditors as a going concern while options are sought short of liquidation. These options include recapitalising the business, selling the business to new owners, or demerging it into elements that can be sold and closing the remainder",

			"Description": "As a legal concept, administration is a procedure under the insolvency laws of a number of common law jurisdictions. It functions as a rescue mechanism for insolvent entities and allows them to carry on running their business. The process – an alternative to liquidation – is often known as going into administration. A company in administration is operated by the administrator (as interim chief executive) on behalf of the creditors as a going concern while options are sought short of liquidation. These options include recapitalising the business, selling the business to new owners, or demerging it into elements that can be sold and closing the remainder",

That cook was Colonel Harland Sanders, of course, and now KFC is the world’s most popular chicken restaurant chain, specializing in that same Original Recipe® along with Extra Crispy™ chicken, home-style sides and buttermilk biscuits. There are over 21,000 KFC outlets in more than 130 countries and territories around the world. And you know what? There’s still a cook in a kitchen in every last one of them, freshly preparing delicious, complete family meals at affordable prices.",

			"Description": "Solving challenges is the very foundation of who we are. After all, in the beginning, our founder, sea captain Robert Fergusson, didn’t particularly care about paint. He just wanted to keep his ship intact. That’s why, when he noticed that an accidental splash of fish oil had stopped the relentless spread of corrosion on his rusty metal deck, he immediately recognized it for what it was: A valuable solution.   The same passion that drove the Captain to spend his next few years creating the world’s first rust-preventative paint still drives us today. When we see a problem, we work diligently until we've perfected a solution—which has led to some of the most cutting-edge, durable and innovative products in the industry.   If you've got a surface you need to protect or a look you want to transform, you've come to the right place. We have a coating for every challenge.   Welcome to Rust-Oleum, home of trusted quality—and powerful solutions—since 1921.  __  Rust-Oleum Corporation is a subsidiary of RPM International, Inc.",

I was encouraged by my soulmate; my twin flame to write, to tell my story in order to help other young girls who have gone through similar situations of child abuse. It may be typical of other books, but this is my story, my journey and is unique to my life. It has taken me years to heal from this journey. It’s taken years of faith and soul searching and conversations with God to make it this far. I have had counseling, I have had rock bottom experiences where I truly felt lost and was in such despair, I was ready to give up.  While I am ready to share my story and while my family knows my truth, only I know the full details in which I am about to share with my readers. I have been afraid to write this book. I used the thought of protecting my family, more specifically, my children and sister as an excuse not to write. Like when I journal, it must be released. I cannot keep it in. God has spoken. It is finally time. I finally know my purpose.",

Year\tEmployees 2000\t5001 2003\t9,000 2004\t23,010 2005\t38,500 2006\t53,000 2007\t74,000 2008\t94,000 2009\t112,900 2010\t131,001 IBM worldwide expects its revenues to be around $120 billion by 2010, of which nearly $86 billion (68%) would come from IBM Global Services alone, with an estimate of about 200,000 employees. IBM India would account for 90,000 of these. Roughly translated, IBM's Indian employees would generate $35 billion of IBM's revenues in 2010.  IBM Global Services (now split to Business Services & Technical Services) was called the \"jewel in the IBM crown\"​ by the Aberdeen group in 2003. For worldwide IBM, this is the group that contributes to more than half its global revenues ($54 billion in 2005) presently and growing at a healthy rate (8% in 2005). With half of global service employees to be located in India, IBM India's importance for the global corporation can be easily fathomed.   IBM India's domestic revenues grew at 60% in 2005-06 making it one of the highest growth areas in the entire IBM portfolio of geographies & businesses. IBM India is also the biggest domestic IT player in the country, replacing HCL Technologies[citation needed]. It's worthwhile to mention that Airtel, India's largest private telecom company which had chosen IBM as its strategic partner for outsourcing its entire network & IT backbone – a deal worth about $750 million initially, has decided to renew it for another five years, reducing the order by more than half the size of the one that expired at the end of March 2014.",

			"Description": "Children suffer human rights abuses disproportionately due to their age and developmental capacity. It is estimated that over 20 million people are trafficked for labor or sexual exploitation throughout the world, including the United States, with women and children comprising the majority of victims. Climate change and environmental toxins have disproportionate health impacts on children, which include poor health outcomes and learning disabilities. Children are increasingly displaced from their homes by violence, crime, orphan hood, discrimination, conflict, and environmental disasters, among other reasons.  Recognizing that children require special protections due to their vulnerabilities, the Center for the Human Rights of Children (CHRC), a University Center of Excellence, was established in 2007 to pursue an agenda of interdisciplinary research, outreach and education, and advocacy to address critical and complex issues affecting children and youth, both locally and globally. The CHRC applies a human-rights approach to the problems affecting children, reaffirming the recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family, including children, is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world. Moreover, it does so with respect for the rights and responsibilities of parents, teachers, and other caregivers entrusted with raising children.   Mission The mission of Loyola's Center for the Human Rights of Children is to advance and protect the rights of children.  Guiding Principles The Center seeks guidance and inspiration from the tradition of Jesuit and Catholic teachings on social justice and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.",

This challenging endeavor draws upon our expertise in diverse and complementary experimental and theoretical techniques that span the physical and life sciences. Brandeis offers an ideal environment for such an interdisciplinary undertaking. Its small size engenders a highly collaborative environment. Its innovative graduate program trains students who work and thrive at the interface of physical and life sciences. Its life science faculty have pioneered biochemical studies of molecular motors and cytoskeletal machinery, its chemists have synthesized biocompatible self-assembling filaments, and its physicists have made important contributions toward understanding soft materials such as liquid  crystals,  gels  and  colloids. Researchers in the BioInspired Soft Materials Center combine elemental building blocks, such as motor proteins, DNA origami and filamentous virus, to understand the emergence of biomimetic functionalities that are highly sought-after in materials science and to synergistically engineer life-like materials.",

			"Description": "Maandelijks kunt u in het Theehuis gevarieerd werk van verschillende kunstenaars bekijken en uiteraard kopen. Halverwege de maand wisselt het werk en worden kunstwerken van andere kunstenaars getoond. De kunstenaars betalen elk slechts hun deel van de huurprijs en hoeven van hun verkopen niets aan de organisatie af te staan. Voor bezoekers en kopers betekent dit dat de prijzen van de kunstwerken niet opgevoerd zijn.   Afgezien van het financiële aspect voor kunstenaars wil het Theehuis een gevarieerd aanbod leveren aan kunstliefhebbers en bezoekers. De kunstenaars komen vaak uit de Zaanstreek, maar dit is geen must. Er wordt namelijk niet gekeken naar de achtergrond of woonplaats van de kunstenaar, maar naar het werk. Het maakt dus evenmin uit of iemand autodidact of afgestudeerd is. Noch wordt het werk beoordeeld, want over kunst kan je lang twisten en mensen hebben daar simpelweg zeer diverse meningen over. Dat kan. Het Theehuis toont het liefst zeer wisselend werk en laat het natuurlijk aan de bezoeker over wat hij of zij mooi vindt. Uiteraard wordt wel gestreefd naar kwaliteit.  ",

Il s’agit d’un service national unique, indépendant du réseau des CPAM, ce qui permet de garantir l’impartialité et l’équité des avis rendus.  Directement rattaché à la Cnam, les Directions régionales du Service médical (DRSM) sont réparties sur tout le territoire et recouvrent plusieurs départements, voire plusieurs régions. Le Service médical est constitué de praticiens conseils (médecins, chirurgiens-dentistes, pharmaciens) et de personnel administratif.   Nos missions    Le contrôle des prestations et les relations avec les assurés Après analyse des dossiers et, si besoin, examen clinique des assurés, nous donnons des avis médicaux qui permettent aux CPAM de verser les prestations. En lien avec le médecin traitant, nous accompagnons les assurés pour améliorer leur prise en charge ou encore prévenir la désinsertion professionnelle.    Les relations avec les professionnels de santé Nous analysons l’activité de prescription des professionnels de santé et des établissements de soins. En cas d’écart aux recommandations médicales, des praticiens-conseils conduisent des actions d’information et de sensibilisation des professionnels de santé (échanges confraternels...). Nous menons également des actions de formation des Délégués de l’Assurance Maladie (Dam), qui contribuent à faire évoluer les pratiques de soins.    Le contrôle contentieux et la lutte contre la fraude Nous analysons l’activité des professionnels de santé et des établissements de santé ainsi que la consommation de soins d’assurés, dans le respect des textes réglementaires, afin de s’assurer de la qualité des soins, de prévenir les abus et de lutter contre la fraude.    Les services en santé En partenariat avec les CPAM , nous proposons différents services en santé comme Sophia, pour le suivi du diabète et de l’asthme, et Prado, programme de retour à domicile, après un accouchement par ex.",

			"Description": "Our Goal is not just another Goal. It is the development of contacts to teams, to bring winners on both sides of the bilateral field between Germany and Brazil together!  Kräfte bündeln und Chancen gemeinsam ergreifen. Das ist der Ansatz des seit 2014 von der Agentur ´hey projects KG`​ privatwirtschaftlich organisierten Unternehmernetzwerkes „NRW goes to Brazil PLUS“ unter der Schirmherrschaft der IHK zu Essen. Kooperationspartner sind die EnergieAgentur.NRW, NRW.International GmbH und die NRW.BANK, ergänzt um die tatkräftige Unterstützung eines breit aufgestellten brasilianischen Partnernetzwerks von Unternehmen, Innovations-Clustern, Industrie-, Handels- und Agrarverbänden sowie Wirtschaftsregionen.   Brasilien ist ein Land mit vielen Möglichkeiten. Allerdings ist der Zugang zu diesem Chancenmarkt im Alleingang nur schwer leistbar. Deshalb bietet das Unternehmernetzwerk „NRW Brasil PLUS“ mittelständischen Unternehmen beider Länder die Möglichkeit, sich gemeinsam gut auf die Bedingungen und Möglichkeiten in unterschiedlichen Regionen Brasiliens (und Deutschlands)vorzubereiten und gezielt im brasilianischen (und deutschen) Markt zu platzieren. Über das von der hey projects KG organisierte Netzwerkbüro werden die Zusammenarbeit der beteiligten Unternehmen gebündelt und konkrete Möglichkeiten und Projekte für den deutschen Mittelstand in Brasilien ebenso wie für den brasilianischen Mittelstand in Deutschland identifiziert.  Nutzen auch Sie diese Plattform als Direkt-Verbindung zwischen dem brasilianischen und deutschen Markt mit den jeweiligen Kompetenzen und Bedürfnissen!   Unsere sehr engen Kontakte zu brasilianischen Unternehmern, Fach-Verbänden, Regionalvertretungen und lokalen Netzwerken nutzen wir für Sie als besonderes Asset zu Ihrem gelungenen Marktzugang.  Mit regelmäßigen Markterkundungsreisen nach Brasilien machen wir Ihnen den wichtigen direkten Einblick vor Ort möglich!",

Pour ce passionné de cuisine et de musique, c’est avant tout une aventure humaine, une énergie partagée avec son équipe et ses clients, une occasion d’avancer ensemble, de créer les plus beaux moments de convivialité… et de citer Steve Jobs : « Mon business-modèle ? Ce sont les Beatles : quatre gars qui s’équilibraient, canalisant les tendances négatives des uns et des autres. Et le tout était meilleur que la somme des parties. C’est comme ça que je vois le business. Dans l’entreprise, les grandes choses ne sont pas le fait d’un seul homme, mais d’une équipe. »  Régie commerciale et logistique sur de grands événements publics, StandBuy devient agence en ajoutant à son offre un bureau d’étude et de tendance spécialisé dans la restauration événementielle. Son activité de conseil a été conçue pour accompagner les organisateurs dans la conception de leur offre F&B et leur garantir un événement unique  Sa démarche s’appuie sur sa capacité à :  Innover : process 100% digitalisés, cashless, ergonomie des espaces,  S’engager : objectifs RSE mesurables  Coordonner : 25 ans de régie événementielle Collaborer : transparence financière et organisationnelle Communiquer : outils et supports mis à disposition des organisateurs Sourcer en local : intervention et recrutement sur toute la France ",
