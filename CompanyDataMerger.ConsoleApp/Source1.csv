Excited?  Calm?    One of the things I love about London is its variety. As you move from one place to another it always makes you feel a bit different. Sometimes the simplest things can spark an interest, emotion or action.   Like when you're at Wembley Stadium and your team scores. You shout at the top of your voice, maybe even spontaneously hugging the stranger next to you.  Or when you’ve just walked into your favourite cafe, your face tingles from the sudden warmth, the coffee smell welcomes you and within moments, you feel relaxed and safe.  All these places influence you, triggering a wash of emotions that starts actions.  Now imagine your brand is a place.    How would you describe it? What emotions would it trigger? Who would you make it for?   I believe that every brand can be unique; you just have to get to know it, hear its story, extract and combine all the elements that prove its quality…  And make it remarkable.

74461737,Vesynta,"London, England, United Kingdom",http://www.vesynta.com,vesynta.com,"Vesynta focuses on precise dosing, that is personal and targeted to the patient’s individual characteristics.  Our technology combines automated desktop hardware with analytical software to provide a universal platform for medicine exposure analysis from patient blood.  Your health is personal, so why isn't your treatment?  Physicians currently determine your medicine dose based upon your body weight or size. Unfortunately, this approach fails to consider the large variability in how individual patients distribute, break-down and clear drugs from the body.   There are many complicating factors which contribute to this variance, including gender, age, ethnicity, nutrition and well-being, none of which are accounted for using traditional dosing approaches.   This leads to inconsistencies between patients in terms of how much drug is achieved in the blood and how long the drugs stay there - also known as medicine exposure.  The end result is patients suffering from poorly treated conditions or dealing with life-limiting side effects associated with critical medicine.  Patients groups that especially suffer with the ‘one size fits all’ approach include: - Paediatrics (under 16 years of age) - Geriatrics (over 65 years of age) - Anephric groups  - Patients on dose intense treatment schedules - Patients with rare genetic disorders - Patients on narrow therapeutic index drugs  Physicians are seeking to implement approaches of routine treatment modifications according to patient response. However, a lack of real-time patient data makes this practice a clinical challenge.   Our purpose is to elevate the safety and effectiveness of medicines in these groups and others. Through revolutionising bedside patient monitoring, we can generate medicine exposure data to enable individualised treatment for better health outcomes.",Medical Devices,2,https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQHm5RprlhZ0Fw/company-logo_400_400/0/1609282706408?e=1617840000&v=beta&t=RzFlLm7Ilm4XpMj1PwukGqkXT62FWRTZni4YFY8T1cw,02-Oct,"Torrington Place,Office 203a, Roberts Engineering Building,England,London,United Kingdom",United Kingdom,England,London,WC1E 7JE,"Office 203a, Roberts Engineering Building",Torrington Place,04/01/2021 11:44,04/01/2021 11:44,https://www.linkedin.com/company/vesyntaltd/

We’ve been shooting headshots for over five years working with actors, acting schools (The Reel Scene), models, and corporate clients across the UK.  The headshot has never been more important in our ever increasingly visual world. The rise of social media combined with the smartphone selfie means that headshots are everywhere and we are being judged on what we upload to the internet. Whether you are an aspiring actor adding a new headshot to your spotlight profile or a company updating headshots on their 'about' page then it’s important to think about what the image says about you. As the name of our studio suggest, we are focused on the purity and honesty of the headshot. It may sound obvious, but a headshot must actually look like you! The biggest mistake a client can make is to expect a photographer to mis-represent or over glamorise them - the last thing a casting director or agent wants is to invite you to an audition and then someone walks through the door who is unrecognisable from the image in front of them. It is our job at Pure Headshots to use our photographic knowledge, experience of lighting, direction and industry expertise, to accurately photograph you at your very best so your headshot ‘pops off the page’.",Photography,1,https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQELG-sXf-_bTg/company-logo_400_400/0/1608661593901?e=1617235200&v=beta&t=gBZKDYkJWcTKUsZ0PiDOUf6Q0Xoww_v7BQZzkw4TXrE,myself only,,,,,,,,29/12/2020 16:42,29/12/2020 16:42,https://www.linkedin.com/company/pure-headshots/

That rustic coffee table you bought a few years ago no longer matches your taste for sleek, modern decor now.  You could easily throw it out, but what is the hidden cost of doing this? The EPA estimates that there are over 10 million tons of furniture waste thrown out every year, and this number is climbing. At Kola Project, we believe that a win for your stylish kitchen or living room doesn't have to be a loss for the environment.  This is what sets us apart from our competitors. Our unlimited take-back program ensures that every piece of unwanted or broken furniture that you give us will be repurposed into something useful and resold. And we'll reward you for doing this!  What else sets us apart?  * Small-scale manufacturing ensures you get handmade or unique designs and high-quality furniture that is more durable.  *Minimalist, biodegradable packaging that gets rid of the wasteful bubble wrap and styrofoam.  *Affordable pieces. Typically, high-quality, luxury furniture with a sustainable approach would cost a lot more.  * Locally sourced materials and suppliers, that are mostly based in Europe.  * No low-quality synthetic woods and vinyl materials that you'll have to throw out in a few months.  * 95% materials are plastic-free  Discover unique homeware pieces and learn about the world of waste-free homeware shopping at our Kola Project website.

For young people.  Growing up, we struggled to find a platform where we could freely express our views. We needed somewhere to channel our thoughts and opinions, but the inaccessibility of mainstream media meant that this felt unattainable.   During the lockdown of Summer 2020 (after eating an obscene amount of banana bread!) we did a lot of thinking. Lockdown, with all its ups and downs, became a time of creation, innovation and exploration, with young people leading the way. A place for young people to be seen, heard and celebrated seemed more important than ever. So, after much planning, The Sundial Journal was born.  The Sundial Journal is a place for young people to write honestly on all things, from global news, to what’s trending on Twitter. It is a platform that welcomes young people of all backgrounds and experiences.  Our sections are News (non-mainstream news and local news), Thoughts (opinion-based pieces), Favourites (for Lifestyle reviews), and Gallery (a multimedia section of art, poetry, and other young people’s work).  We are currently a volunteer-led publication, so unfortunately we cannot offer any payment, but this is something we hope to change in the future.

The studio focuses on self-initiated transforming design with our office based in London, U.K while manufacturing our products in Antwerp, Belgium.  Our designs are a reflection of our team’s commitment and their drive to innovate our future.  THE CONCEPT  The world’s growing population has resulted in an increased demand for space and resources, both of which are getting scarce. Similar effects can be witnessed in urban cities, where accommodations are getting smaller to contain the increasing populace. Transforming furniture is a solution that makes better and efficient use of the available space.  Metropolitan Collection  Elements that unfold make it possible to keep everything compact, leaving the interior bright and open. Opting for skinny framed furniture allows all-important daylight to flow right through a room, while heavier set furniture can block out the light.  The collection creates choice in how a person sets up the interior. Having a minimal amount of storage space, a high variety of furniture layout options are easily accessible.

As it stands now, it is obvious that early diagnostics is possible, however, there are practical challenges in terms of the accessibility and extensiveness of the actual test. Sognef was founded with the intent of providing a solution to a necessity that has been overlooked for decades because of the regimented shape of the industry where costs are high, automation and accessibility are low, consolidation and comprehensiveness is absent, and markets are geared towards specialized physicians preventing proper and effective early diagnostics/screening.

With > 99.99% efficacy (US SGS lab tested), XTI-360™ is free of any chemical binders and leaves no toxic residue from dead germs. The self-cleaning coating works continuously, 24/7, and one treatment lasts for at least one year. It can be applied to virtually any surface, indoors and out, including metal, plastic, glass, electronics, fabric, ceramic, stone, tile, wood, and textiles. The coating is 100% green, non-toxic, non-flammable, and RoHS compliant, so it can be used on surfaces common in the hospitality industry, such as food preparation and storage stations, and, XTI-360™ can keep guest rooms allergy-free. In addition to preventing surface transmission of germs and viruses, XTI-360™ can also be used to combat the spread of harmful airborne microbes. When applied to components of a building’s HVAC system, such as ducts and filters, the coating continuously kills virus and bacteria germs in recirculating air as they pass through a facility’s ventilation systems. This also assists facilities in killing all odors, including smoke and those associated with pet-friendly rooms.
